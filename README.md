# PacMen

### This project gives the user a button to generate PacMen one a time and another to put the Pacmen in motion.  
### Each PacMan is initalized with a randomized location, direction, and velocity. PacMen bounce of the walls of our window, reversing direction when the edge is detected. 

### Through this project, I learned how to make a factory of elements, how to use callback functions, how to generate motion, and how to detect edges.

### In the future I plan to advance this concept by using multiple images to animate PacMan so that he chomps across the screen and faces the direction he travels.
